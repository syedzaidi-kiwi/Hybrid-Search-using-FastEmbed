The 2024/25 wheat outlook for the US and globally, as per the June 2024 report, indicates larger supplies and increased export potential, particularly with reduced competition from Black Sea region exports. 

**US Wheat Outlook:**
- Supplies: Up with an increase in all-wheat production, forecast at 1,875 million bushels, a boost in Hard Red Winter production, and a slight increase in yield to 49.4 bushels per acre. 
- Domestic Use: Unchanged from previous estimates.
- Exports: Forecast to rise to 800 million bushels, as US wheat becomes more price-competitive with reduced Black Sea supplies. 
- Ending Stocks: Lowered slightly to 758 million bushels, still a significant volume. 

**Global Wheat Outlook:** 
- The key global factor is the reduction in exportable supplies from the Black Sea region, likely due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
- This reduction benefits US wheat exports, making them more competitive on the global market. 
- No specific global supply, use, or stock figures are mentioned in the provided text, but the increased US exports will contribute to global availability. 

In summary, the June 2024 report suggests improved prospects for US wheat in the 2024/25 period, with a positive export outlook due to global supply shifts. This could impact global wheat markets and prices as US wheat fills some of the gaps left by reduced Black Sea exports.

The 2024/25 wheat outlook for the US and globally, as per the June 2024 report, indicates larger supplies and increased export potential, particularly with reduced competition from Black Sea region exports. 

**US Wheat Outlook:**
- Supplies: Up with an increase in all-wheat production forecast at 1,875 million bushels, a rise of 17 million from the previous month. This is due to higher Hard Red Winter production, despite reductions in Soft Red and White Winter varieties. 
- Yield: The all-wheat yield is expected to be 49.4 bushels per acre, an increase of 0.5 bushels from the previous month's estimate. 
- Domestic Use: This is expected to remain unchanged. 
- Exports: The forecast has increased by 25 million bushels to 800 million. US wheat prices are becoming more competitive, and with reduced supplies from the Black Sea region, exports are expected to rise. 
- Ending Stocks: These are slightly lower at 758 million bushels but still considered significant. 

**Global Wheat Outlook:** 
The global wheat market is expected to feel the impact of reduced exportable supplies from the Black Sea region, which will make US wheat more competitive. This is likely to result in increased US exports, as mentioned above. No further details are provided in the text provided about the global outlook for the 2024/25 season. However, with the US expecting larger supplies and increased exports, this could indicate a tighter global wheat balance sheet, assuming normal production and consumption patterns in other major producing and consuming regions.
